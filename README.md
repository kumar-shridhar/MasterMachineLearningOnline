# MastersInMachineLearningOnline
Online Content equivalent to Machine Learning Master Degree at an University. 
I am pursuing a Masters in Machine Learning and AI at University of Kaiserslautern, Germany. However, there are alternatives to the content that I have learned over two years available online and this repository contains a curated list of those contents. Some suggestions to the projects and master thesis will also be included. The list will keep on changing depending with the new available better choices.

Following is the list of courses that I learned at the university and their alternatives:

* [Very Deep Learning](https://www.informatik.uni-kl.de/en/studium/lehrveranstaltungen/modulhb/#mod-89-7157)
  * Available alternatives online :
    * [Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org)
    * [Stanford CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
    * [Stanford CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/)
    * [Deep Learning in Neural Networks: An Overview](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.7828)
    * A [project](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/reports.html) or a [Kaggle competition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/reports.html)
